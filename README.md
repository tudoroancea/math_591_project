### Setup workspace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tudoroancea/math_591_project
cd math_591_project
mamba env create --file env.yml # or conda env create --file env.yml if you don't use mamba, but it's a shame not to use it since it's simply much MUCH faster
conda activate math_591_project
wget 
```
